# Mirireoluwa's Progeam to solve a quadratic equation

ASK	   “ Type in values for a, b, and c respectively”

INPUT   user inputs a value for a, b, and c respectively.

STORE   user’s input as “a”, “b”, and “c”

DISPLAY 	discriminant formula to solve for the roots of the quadratic equation

STORE   discriminant as “d”

IF  d >  “ 0 ”	THEN	   	 
		OUTPUT  “ The roots of the quadratic equation are ‘Real and Unequal’ and they are: ”



IF  d  <  “ 0 ”
	THEN
		OUTPUT  “ The roots of the quadratic equation are ‘Imaginary’ and they are: ”

IF  d  =  “ 0 ”
	THEN
		OUTPUT  “ The roots of the quadratic equation are ‘Real and Equal’ and they are: ”

ELSE
		OUTPUT  “ Your input is invalid ”
