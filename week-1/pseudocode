ASK	   “ what problem would you like to solve? ”

INPUT   the user inputs a value between 1, 2, and 3 for the problem they would like to solve.

STORE   the user’s input as select

IF  select  =  “ 1 ”	
    THEN
		OUTPUT  “ You have selected the Simple Interest formula ”
			    “ The formula for Simple Interest is A = P(1 + (R/100) * T) ”

INPUT  the user inputs the value for the principal, rate, and time they would like to be calculated
		OUTPUT  “ The Simple Interest for the inputted values is: ”



IF  select  =  “ 2 ”
	THEN
		OUTPUT  “ You have selected the Compound Interest formula ”
			    “ The formula for Compound Interest is A = P(1 + R/n) ^ nt ”
INPUT  the user inputs the value for the principal, rate, number of years, and time they would like to be calculated
		OUTPUT  “The Compound Interest for the inputted values is: ”



IF select  =  “ 3 ”
	THEN
		OUTPUT  “ You have selected the Annuity Plan formula ”
			    “ The Annuity Plan formula is A = PMT * [(1 + R/n) ^ (nt) - 1] / (R/n) ”
INPUT  the user inputs the values for the PMT, rate, number of years, and time they would like to be calculated
		OUTPUT  “The Annuity plan is: ”
ELSE
		OUTPUT  “ You have made no selection ”


OUTPUT  “ Thank you for using Mirireoluwa’s Program. ”
